## Architecture
### Server (discarded)
Basic server NodeJS expressJS that acts as API gateway. Use a local json file to act as database.
### Client
Goodies Angular 2 & Twitter Bootstrap 3. A dashboard that helps the zoo director to monitor his unicorns. 

The data persistence is now done with browser's localStorage, instead of relying on a NodeJS server.

## Running
```
// server side
npm start
// client side
ng serve
```

## Features
### Watch the unicorns eating grass peacefully in this zoo
### Buy a new unicorn and put it in this zoo
### Mating between a male unicorn and a female one

## Bonus
### Free all the unicorns!
Basically, free all the unicorns from the database, in case that you fear that you can't feed them all.
